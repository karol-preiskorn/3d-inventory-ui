# Production Deployment Summary - October 7, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: 401 Authentication Errors ✅

**Status**: FIXED
**Root Cause**: Missing AuthGuard on protected routes
**Solution**: Added `canActivate: [AuthGuard]` to all data management routes

### Issue #2: 400 Log Creation Errors ✅

**Status**: FIXED
**Root Cause**: Passing objects instead of strings to `message` parameter
**Solution**: Convert objects to JSON strings using `JSON.stringify()`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Verification

```bash
cd /home/karol/GitHub/3d-inventory-ui

# Run linting
npm run lint:check

# Run tests
npm test

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 2. Build Production Version

```bash
# Build with production configuration
npm run build:prod

# Expected output: dist/3d-inventory-angular-ui/
```

### 3. Deploy to Google Cloud Run

```bash
# Deploy using the deployment script
./deploy.sh

# This will:
# - Build Docker image
# - Push to Google Container Registry
# - Deploy to Cloud Run (europe-west1)
# - Configure: 512Mi memory, 1 CPU, port 8080
```

### 4. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Get service URL
gcloud run services describe d-inventory-ui \
  --region europe-west1 \
  --format 'value(status.url)'

# Expected: https://d-inventory-ui-HASH-ew.a.run.app

# Test accessibility
curl -I https://3d-inventory.ultimasolution.pl
```

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Test #1: Authentication Guard (Critical)

#### Unauthenticated Access Test

```bash
# Test Steps:
1. Open browser in incognito mode
2. Navigate to: https://3d-inventory.ultimasolution.pl/attribute-dictionary-list
3. Expected: Redirect to /login?returnUrl=/attribute-dictionary-list
4. Should NOT see: 401 error or attribute dictionary page
```

#### Authenticated Access Test

```bash
# Test Steps:
1. Login with credentials: carlo / carlo123!
2. Navigate to: https://3d-inventory.ultimasolution.pl/attribute-dictionary-list
3. Expected: Page loads with 4 attribute dictionaries
4. Should NOT see: Any errors
```

#### Return URL Test

```bash
# Test Steps:
1. While logged out, navigate to: /edit-device/123
2. Expected: Redirect to /login?returnUrl=/edit-device/123
3. Login with valid credentials
4. Expected: Automatic redirect back to /edit-device/123
```

### Test #2: Log Creation (Critical)

#### Delete Operation Test

```bash
# Test Steps (for each entity type):
1. Navigate to attribute-dictionary-list
2. Click "Delete" on any item
3. Expected: Item deleted successfully
4. Should NOT see: 400 error
5. Check browser console: No errors
```

#### Clone Operation Test

```bash
# Test Steps (for each entity type):
1. Navigate to attribute-dictionary-list
2. Click "Clone" on any item
3. Expected: New item created
4. Should NOT see: 400 error
5. Verify: New item appears in list
```

#### Log Verification

```bash
# Verify logs were created properly
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://d-inventory-api-wzwe3odv7q-ew.a.run.app/logs?limit=10

# Expected: Logs with JSON-stringified messages like:
# "message": "{\"id\":\"...\",\"action\":\"Delete attribute dictionary\"}"
```

### Test #3: Core Functionality

#### Navigation Test

```bash
- Test all main navigation links
- Verify: All links work correctly
- Verify: Protected routes redirect to login if not authenticated
```

#### CRUD Operations Test

```bash
For each entity type (devices, models, attributes, etc.):
1. Create new entity
2. Edit existing entity
3. Delete entity
4. Clone entity (if available)
5. Verify: All operations work without errors
```

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur:

### Quick Rollback (Emergency)

```bash
# Revert to previous Cloud Run revision
gcloud run services update-traffic d-inventory-ui \
  --region europe-west1 \
  --to-revisions PREVIOUS_REVISION=100
```

### Code Rollback

```bash
cd /home/karol/GitHub/3d-inventory-ui

# Revert auth guard changes
git revert <commit-hash-auth-guard>

# Revert log fix changes
git revert <commit-hash-log-fix>

# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build:prod
./deploy.sh
```

## Monitoring Checklist

### First Hour After Deployment

- [ ] Check error rates in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Monitor authentication success/failure rates
- [ ] Verify log creation success rates
- [ ] Check API response times
- [ ] Monitor 401 error count (should be near zero for authenticated users)
- [ ] Monitor 400 error count (should be near zero)

### First Day After Deployment

- [ ] Review all error logs
- [ ] Check user feedback
- [ ] Verify all features working
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Check database log entries

### Metrics to Track

```bash
# Error rates (should decrease)
- 401 Unauthorized: < 1% (only from legitimate logouts)
- 400 Bad Request: 0% (for log creation)
- 500 Server Error: < 0.1%

# Success rates (should increase)
- Login success: > 95%
- Log creation: 100%
- CRUD operations: > 99%

# Performance
- Page load time: < 2s
- API response time: < 500ms
- Time to interactive: < 3s
```
