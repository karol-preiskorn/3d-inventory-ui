# ‚úÖ User Service Error - RESOLVED

## üéØ **Problem Identified & Fixed**

### **Issue:**

The `UserService` was hardcoded to use `http://localhost:8080` instead of using the environment configuration, causing Status 0 errors when no local API server was running on port 8080.

### **Root Cause:**

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: Hardcoded localhost URL
private readonly API_URL = 'http://localhost:8080'; // Update based on your API URL
```

### **Solution Applied:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ AFTER: Using environment configuration
import { environment } from '../../environments/environment';

private readonly API_URL = environment.baseurl; // Use environment configuration
```

## üîß **Changes Made**

### **File:** `src/app/services/user.service.ts`

1. **Added environment import:**

   ```typescript
   import { environment } from '../../environments/environment'
   ```

2. **Updated API_URL declaration:**
   ```typescript
   private readonly API_URL = environment.baseurl; // Use environment configuration
   ```

## ‚úÖ **Result**

Now the `UserService` will use the same API URL as other services:

- **Development:** `https://3d-inventory-api.ultimasolution.pl` (production API)
- **All services** now consistently use `environment.baseurl`
- **No more Status 0 errors** from hardcoded localhost URLs

## üöÄ **What This Fixes**

### **Before:**

- ‚ùå UserService tried to connect to `http://localhost:8080/users`
- ‚ùå No local API server running on port 8080
- ‚ùå Status 0 error: "Http failure response for http://localhost:8080/users: 0 undefined"

### **After:**

- ‚úÖ UserService connects to `https://3d-inventory-api.ultimasolution.pl/users`
- ‚úÖ Consistent with AuthenticationService and other services
- ‚úÖ Uses production API server which is healthy and running
- ‚úÖ Proper CORS configuration for requests from Angular app

## üß™ **Verification**

The user service will now:

1. Use the same API endpoint as authentication
2. Work with the production API server
3. Respect environment configuration changes
4. Be consistent with all other services

## üìù **Additional Notes**

- All other services (DeviceService, etc.) were already using `environment.baseurl` correctly
- Only UserService had the hardcoded localhost URL
- Test files still use localhost:8080 for mocking, which is correct for testing

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - UserService now uses environment configuration consistently with other services.
