## 📊 Test Results

### Security Verification Tests

All AdminGuard tests are passing, confirming that:

1. ✅ **Admin users can access admin routes**
   - Test validates that users with `role: 'admin'` can access `/admin/users`

2. ✅ **Non-admin users are blocked**
   - Regular users (`role: 'user'`) are redirected to `/home`
   - Viewer users (`role: 'viewer'`) are redirected to `/home`

3. ✅ **Unauthenticated users are redirected**
   - Users not logged in are redirected to `/login`

4. ✅ **Child routes are protected**
   - Admin can access child routes like `/admin/users/edit/:id`
   - Non-admin users are blocked from child routes

5. ✅ **Security logging is active**
   - Access denied warnings are logged to console
   - Audit trail maintained for security monitoring

---

## 🔒 Security Warnings (Expected Behavior)

The test output shows console warnings - **this is correct and expected**:

```
console.warn
  Access denied: User user attempted to access admin area without admin role

console.warn
  Access denied: User viewer attempted to access admin area without admin role
```

**Why these warnings appear:**

- The tests verify that non-admin users are properly blocked
- When blocked, the AdminGuard logs a security warning
- These warnings help with security auditing and monitoring
- This is **intentional behavior**, not an error
