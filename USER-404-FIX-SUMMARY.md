# ✅ User Service 404 Error - RESOLVED

## 🎯 **Problem Identified & Fixed**

### **Issue:**

The `UserService` was trying to access `/users` endpoint, but the API server actually uses `/user-management` as the endpoint.

### **Root Cause:**

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE: Wrong endpoint path
private readonly USERS_ENDPOINT = '/users';
```

**API Server Reality:**

- ✅ Actual endpoint: `/user-management`
- ❌ UserService was trying: `/users`
- **Result:** 404 Not Found error

### **Solution Applied:**

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER: Correct endpoint path
private readonly USERS_ENDPOINT = '/user-management';
```

## 🔧 **API Server Endpoint Structure**

Based on the API server code analysis:

### **User Management Endpoints:**

- `GET /user-management` - Get all users (Admin only)
- `POST /user-management` - Create new user (Admin only)
- `GET /user-management/me` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /user-management/me` - Update current user profile
- `GET /user-management/{id}` - Get user by ID
- `PUT /user-management/{id}` - Update user by ID
- `DELETE /user-management/{id}` - Delete user by ID

### **Authentication Requirements:**

- All endpoints require authentication (`Bearer` token)
- Admin endpoints require `admin` role
- User can access own profile with `user` role

## ✅ **Verification**

### **Endpoint Test:**

```bash
curl https://3d-inventory-api.ultimasolution.pl/user-management
# Returns: 401 Unauthorized (correct - requires auth)
```

### **Previous vs Current:**

- **Before:** `https://3d-inventory-api.ultimasolution.pl/users` → 404 Not Found
- **After:** `https://3d-inventory-api.ultimasolution.pl/user-management` → 401 Unauthorized (requires auth)

## 🚀 **What This Fixes**

### **Before:**

- ❌ 404 error: "Http failure response for https://3d-inventory-api.ultimasolution.pl/users: 404"
- ❌ Endpoint `/users` doesn't exist on API server

### **After:**

- ✅ Connects to correct endpoint `/user-management`
- ✅ Proper authentication handling with Bearer token
- ✅ Should work when user is properly authenticated

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

To verify the fix works:

1. **Ensure user is logged in** with valid credentials
2. **Authentication service** should provide Bearer token
3. **UserService calls** will now go to correct endpoint
4. **Should return user data** instead of 404 error

### **Expected Flow:**

1. User logs in → Gets JWT token
2. UserService calls `/user-management` with Bearer token
3. API server authenticates and returns user data
4. No more 404 errors

## 📋 **Other Services Status**

All other services are correctly configured:

- ✅ **AuthenticationService** - Uses `/login` (correct)
- ✅ **DeviceService** - Uses `/devices` (correct)
- ✅ **ModelsService** - Uses `/models` (correct)
- ✅ **UserService** - Now uses `/user-management` (fixed)

---

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - UserService now uses correct API endpoint `/user-management`

**Next Step:** Verify authentication works properly and user management features function correctly.
